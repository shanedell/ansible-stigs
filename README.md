## How To Use

Both site files target remote systems. Follow below for how to run the sites.

1. Clone repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shanedell/ansible-stigs.git
    ```
2. Run ansible-playbook command from inside of `ansible-stigs` folder.

    - Using inventory file
        
        ```bash
        ansible-playbook -i <inventory-file-path> <site-file>
        ```

        - Replace `<inventory-file>` with the path to the desired inventory file.
        - Replace `<site-file>` with either `ubuntu2004.site.yml` or `win2022.site.yml`.

    - Using IP address
        
        ```bash
        ansible-playbook -i <ip-address>, <site-file>
        ```

        - Replace `<ip-address>` with the desired IP address.
        - Replace `<site-file>` with either `ubuntu2004.site.yml` or `win2022.site.yml`.

**NOTICE:** When using IP address, make sure that after the IP address a comma (`,`) is present, otherwise the command will fail or the playbook will not get ran properly.
